"""CAPTURING RAINWATER
Capturing Rainwater
Create a capturing_rainwater() function that takes in an array of heights, and returns the amount of rainwater that could be contained in that array.

For example, the array [4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2] can be represented in the following histogram:Histogram with the Y-axis going from 0 to 4 and the X-axis containing the numbers from the array. Water is pooled in the empty spaces of the histogram, and you can see that it can contain 6 units of water.As you can see, there are 6 units of water that can be contained, so capturing_rainwater([4, 2, 1, 3, 0, 1, 2]) will return 6.
This challenge was reported to have been asked at interviews with many top companies, including Amazon and Microsoft. If youâ€™ve covered the material in Pass the Technical Interview with Python or an equivalent, you should be able to solve this challenge.
